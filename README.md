# [modality](https://kairuz.github.io/modality)

Music-theory library based on [heptatonic scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptatonic_scale), being scales made up of 7 notes over a 12 semitone octave.

The four scales implemented are
- The Major Scale
- The Harmonic Minor Scale
- The Harmonic Major Scale
- The Melodic Minor Scale

The library supports changing keys, scales, modes, and chords.

The repo also contains [sample usage with a virtual piano](https://kairuz.github.io/modality) demonstrating this functionality.

MIDI playing is implemented using a fork of [surikov's WebAudioFont](https://github.com/surikov/webaudiofont).
